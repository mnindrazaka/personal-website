                My primary development tool is React. I start using React since
                2017. It uses one-way data binding to make state changes more
                predictable. It also uses JSX instead of template syntax, so I
                can use my javascript knowledge to build the logic and donâ€™t
                need to learn the template syntax

                React is a great library for client-side rendering. But
                sometimes we need server-side rendering to improve the initial
                loading performance of the website and enable SEO. Next.js helps
                me to implement server-side rendering using React.

              When I teach, I give a brief explanation of the topic and the
              problem related to it. After the students struggle with the
              problem, I will show them how to solve it. I avoid giving the
              solution in the beginning. I want them to struggle to find the
              solution first. Struggling will help them to understand the
              solution that I will give later. I develop a learning platform
              called Lentera to help me teaching with that kind of experience.

            When developing some projects, I found myself often implement the
            same logic again and again, so I separate it and make a library from
            it.

            Every day we learn new things and keep improving. But, it is hard to
            Remember everything that we learned. So I write blog posts that
            explain what I just learn. So it will help me remember it in the
            future. Also, I can share it with other people so they can learn too
            and give me a feedback
